# Arrays Repository

This repository contains various Java programs related to array manipulation, algorithms, and problem-solving. 
The programs demonstrate a wide range of array operations, from basic tasks like printing arrays to more complex algorithms like Kadane's Algorithm and the Rain Water Trapping problem.

## RainWater.java
This program solves the "Rain Water Trapping" problem using an efficient approach. It calculates the maximum water that can be trapped between bars of different heights in an array.

## checkAscendingOrder.java
This program checks whether an array is sorted in ascending order. It returns `true` if the array is sorted and `false` otherwise.

## kadaneAlgo.java
Kadane's Algorithm is used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in an array. This program efficiently solves this problem using a dynamic programming approach.

## largestElement.java
This program finds the largest element in an array.

## maxMin.java
This program finds both the maximum and minimum elements in an array in a single traversal.

## printNum.java
A simple program that prints all the numbers from an array.

## printString.java
This program prints all the strings from a string array.

## reverseArray.java
This program reverses the elements of an array.

## sudoku.java
A Java program that checks the validity of a Sudoku board and solves the puzzle.
